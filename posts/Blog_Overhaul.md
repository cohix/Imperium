Starting in January I will be doing an internship with the WordPress VIP team, and in preparation for that, I've cleared out all my previous blog posts. I'm super excited for everything I'm going to learn during my work term, and over the course of the semester I will be posting regular blog entries with tutorials and programming tips that I discover. I'm in the process of overhauling my website for the new year, making it cleaner and a bit more minimalist. I look forward to everything that's coming!

Cheers!
