##NodeJS Content Management Platform

Imperium is a lightweight content management system that gives you **absolute power** over your content using plaintext files and markdown syntax. 

##Features
* Three commands to get Imperium running
* Configurable using a single config.json file

* Optional MongoDB cache for maximum performance
* Minimal dependencies - install in < 10sec
* Beautiful and responsive default theme
