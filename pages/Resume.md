##EDUCATION

###Carleton University Bachelor of Computer Science

*Mobile Computing Stream, 2013-2017*

At Carleton University in Ottawa, I am entering second year in the Mobile Computing stream of the Computer Science degree. I am experienced with many programming languages and related skills such as version control and Object-Oriented software design. The Mobile Computing stream focuses on full-stack development. I have experience with front-end development on iOS (in Objective-C and Swift), Android (in Java), and the web (in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery). Additionally, I have back-end experience using NodeJS, PHP, Apache, and MongoDB. Our curriculum also puts a large emphasis on algorithm efficiency and Object-Oriented software design. Other theories such as recursion and permutation are also taught. I have very strong Object-Oriented experience in Python, Java, Ruby, and Objective-C.

* Python: Object-Oriented projects, filesystem management, multimedia, PyGame, recursion, Robot Testing Framework, and Django.
* Java:  Object-Oriented projects, Java GUI's, file I-O, Android development, jUnit testing, and recursion.
* Ruby: Object-Oriented Projects, JSON and XML projects, Robot Testing Framework
* Objective-C/Swift: Object-Oriented projects, iOS development, and the XCTest framework.
My other skills include a strong knowledge of the Git version-control system, experience with the Agile Software Development Cycle, and the ability to work seamlessly with teams of designers and programmers alike.

###Earl of March High School

*Graduated with Honors- 2009 - 2013*

At Earl of March, I graduated with honors and an award for community involvement. I was the head of the school's A/V crew, overseeing countless events during my 4 years at the school. I pursued electives in Computer Science and Computer Engineering, as well as Biology and Math.
