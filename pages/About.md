**Hello!** My name is Connor Hicks.  
I am a Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I specialize in mobile computing (apps), web services, and automation. I've previously worked at Airbus (Defence and Space division) and will be working at WordPress in the new year. I am working towards becoming an experienced developer, and starting in January 2015 I will be using my blog to post tutorials and tips for a variety of programming topics. I am still learning, and I like to share the things I learn such that others can learn too! I'll be updating this site in early 2015 with a new design and I'll start posting on the blog much more frequently after that!

I am currently developing a new themeable blog platform called Imperium that is based on NodeJS. This site is running atop it, and you can learn more about it on my <a href = '/Imperium'> Imperium </a> page!
  
Cheers!
-CH
