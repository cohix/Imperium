##NodeJS Content Management System

Imperium is a lightweight content management system that gives you **absolute power** over your content using plaintext files and markdown syntax. [My website](http://beta.cohix.ca) is the official demo site for Imperium and its default theme. Imperium is offered under the MIT licence, which you can read in Imperium/docs/licence.md

####Please Note:
This product is still in its early stages of development. The documentation is not nearly complete. The theming system is also not nearly complete. If you wish to help with documentation, please send me an email (connor at cohix dot ca). Feature requests can also be sent there, but please keep bug reports here on github. Most of all, please fork and develop, if you can!

This branch of cohix/Imperium is the source for my website, [cohix.ca](http://cohix.ca). Visit the master branch for the clean source code.
